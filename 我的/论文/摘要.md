随着人们生活水平的提升，几乎每个家庭都拥有小车，而随着车辆数量的不断增加，寻找车位变得越来越困难，尤其是在大城市，有时要花几十分钟才能找到停车位。人们驾车外出时，路途中交通堵塞，到达目的地后，很难找到合适的停车位，甚至停车位离目的地很远，使便利的代步工具变成了出行的包袱。停车位是车主的重要需求之一，当整个城市加速驶入汽车社会，城市却尚未准备周全，空间有限、车位紧缺，“停车难、停车乱”频频出现，停车问题已成为现代城市发展过程中面临的重要问题。

本选题为“基于Android的智能车位搜索系统设计与实现”，就是为了解决以上问题，设计一款车位搜索系统，帮助开车的用户能在目的地附近快速找到停车的地方，能够有效帮助用户减少寻找停车场的时间，让用户不再因为停车难而烦恼。

本项目成果为一款安卓App，客户端使用Android Studio进行安卓开发，后端使用Ktor框架开发，使用MongoDB作为数据库，前后端之间采用Http协议进行通信。后端将部署在云服务器上，客户端将发布成一款可用的安卓App。

With the improvement of people's living standards, almost every family has a car, and with the increasing number of vehicles, it becomes more and more difficult to find parking spaces, especially in big cities, sometimes it takes dozens of minutes to find parking spaces. When people drive out, there is a traffic jam on the road. When they arrive at the destination, it is difficult to find a suitable parking space, or even the parking space is far away from the destination, which makes the convenient means of transportation become a burden of travel. Parking space is one of the important needs of car owners. When the whole city accelerates into the automobile society, the city has not been well prepared, space is limited, parking space is short, "parking is difficult, parking disorder" frequently appears, parking problem has become an important problem in the process of modern urban development.

This topic is "design and implementation of intelligent parking space search system based on Android", which is to solve the above problems, design a parking space search system, which can help driving users quickly find a parking place near the destination, effectively help users reduce the time to find a parking lot, and let users no longer worry about the difficulty of parking.

The result of this project is an android app, the client uses Android studio for Android development, the back end uses ktor framework for development, uses mongodb as the database, and the front and back end uses HTTP protocol for communication. The back end will be deployed on the cloud server, and the client will be released as an available android app.
